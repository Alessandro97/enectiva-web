<h2 class="feature__title">Administration Buildings</h2>
<div class="feature__inner">
<p>Enectiva is a complex software solution designed for building owners, administrators and property
and facility managers. It offers comprehensive information about energy management, as well as
about the usability of the leased areas, about the results of cost-saving projects and measures and
about the tenants' invoices. In this way, Enectiva makes administration of buildings and building
compounds both easier and cheaper. When combined with automatic and remote meter reading
systems, Enectiva enables you to calculate the charges of individual tenants automatically.
Information about operating expenditure, as well as revision and waste collection fees, is also
included in the system.
One of the benefits of the system is that your tenants can have access to the application so that they
may keep track of their consumption expenses.</p>

<h2 class="feature__title">Schools, hospitals, libraries and other public buildings</h2>
<div class="feature__inner">
<p>Enectiva is an ideal solution for energy management of school buildings, government offices, fire
stations or medical facilities. Thanks to Enectiva, those who administer such buildings always know
the amount of consumed energy and the corresponding expenses. It only takes several clicks to
detect wasting or compare energy consumption with regards to the area used, the number of pupils
or the number of patients. Enectiva automatically analyzes cost-saving measures, evaluates them
and assesses their revenue. Meter readings are easily entered and archived in the system. Employees
may be given various kinds of access to the system as well as different rights. The result is a
complete, more efficient administration of a public building that leads to up to 20% of savings in its
operation.</p>

<p><strong>Main benefits of the public buildings segment</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduced administration in terms of the building operation;</li>

<h2 class="feature__title">Sport centers</h2>
<div class="feature__inner">
<p>Playgrounds, swimming pools, water parks – all these places have high demands in terms of energy
consumption and it is difficult to keep them profitable. This is why it is crucial to operate all the
technology efficiently – and Enectiva will help you. You will get precise information about the
performance and consumption of technological devices such as heating, cooling, lighting or
humidifying systems. Such technology not only influences the interior microclimate of the building,
but depending on the outside climate it also has a significant impact on the total operating expenses.
Most businesses and operations underestimate how important it is to have the technological
equipment turn off when it is not actually needed. It is often the case that heating is working even
though the outside temperature allows it not to, or the AC unit is turned on even though there is
nobody in the building, etc. If such wasting is eliminated, the savings in operating expenditure may
go up to 20%.</p>

<p><strong>Main benefits of the sport and wellness centers segment</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>effective operation of technology in terms of energy management;</li>
