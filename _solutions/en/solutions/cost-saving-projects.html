<h1>Cost-saving projects</h1>

<p>If you are about to install LED lighting, cogeneration units, solar panels or other technology, you
certainly need to know what is the revenue of these installations. By remotely collecting data in
real-time, Enectiva automatically assesses economic parameters of cost-saving projects. Instead of
dealing with tedious administration of energy-related data, you simply receive reports, as well as
alerts, from Enectiva in form of text messages or e-mails. Our analysis and monitoring can be also
used for EPC projects â€“ all the involved parties may have access to its results.
