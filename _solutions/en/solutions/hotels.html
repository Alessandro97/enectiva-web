<h1>Hotels</h1>

<p>Typically, hotels are, compared to other types of buildings, much more progressive in terms of
energy efficiency â€“ this is caused by the fact that efficiency of operation and therefore the revenue of
the business is at the centre of the attention of the management of any hotel. The automatic
reporting system will allow you to keep track of what is the average amount of water used per one
guest, or what are the expenses on energy during the winter season or what is the best time for
buying energy for the next year. Moreover, you will be able to monitor the energy demands of
kitchens or other sections of the building through automatic reports you will regularly receive.
Operating expenses will be reduced as the processes connected to energy management are made
completely automatic by Enectiva.
