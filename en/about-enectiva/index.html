<h2>Connection to EEX and PXE Energy Exchanges</h2>
<p>With this feature you can keep track of the development at energy exchanges in Prague and in Germany. The application notifies you automatically of the most convenient time for energy purchase with regard to your portfolio.</p>

<h2>Detailed Analyses of Savings and Cost-Saving Measures</h2>
<p>Each event on your building is recorded in the application. If you invest with the intention to lower the energy costs of the building, not only does Enectiva monitor the consumption reduction, but it also calculates the return of the investment, cash-flow, and other economic parameters of your project.</p>

<h2>Google Maps Support</h2>
<p>The location of each building is accurately entered into the map. You are therefore constantly in touch with your portfolio, and you simply choose which building you want to analyze directly in the map.</p>

<h2>Integration of Weather in the Location of the Building</h2>
<p>Thanks to the connection to weather stations, you can compare buildings with one another with regard to the outside climatic conditions. Thus, you can find out easily the influence of temperature in a particular area on the heat or gas consumption.</p>

<h2 class="clear">Support of Remote and Mass Manual Meter Reading</h2>
	
<p>Meter reading data are always the basis of energy management. Enectiva enables you to effectively enter mass readings of the entire portfolio, and to collect data from the automatic readings systems as well.</p>
