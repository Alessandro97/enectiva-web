<h1>Cost-saving projects</h1>

<p>If you are about to install LED lighting, cogeneration units, solar panels or other technology, you
certainly need to know what is the revenue of these installations. By <a href="/en/features/#Import">remotely collecting data</a> in
real-time, Enectiva automatically assesses economic parameters of cost-saving projects. Instead of
dealing with tedious administration of energy-related data, you simply <a href="/en/features/#Reports">receive reports</a>, as well as
alerts, from Enectiva in form of text messages or e-mails. Our analysis and monitoring can be also
used for EPC projects â€“ all the involved parties may have access to its results.
